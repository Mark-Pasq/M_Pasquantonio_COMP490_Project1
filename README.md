# This is Project 1 Agile Sprint 2.  It is designed to build on the first Agile Sprint, where we took
# some data from a Github job board, then saved it to a text file.  For Sprint 2, we had to take the data
# from Sprint 1, and create a SQLite database and subsequent table to display the data.

# I started of pretty well and was able to get the data and set up a table, but had difficulties getting
# the data into the table so it could be manipulated.

# I was finally able to import the data and create some tests to see if things were working, but testing
# continues to be a struggle for me.

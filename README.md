# This is Project 1 Agile Sprint 3.  It is designed to build on the first two Agile Sprints, where we took
# some data from a Github job board, then saved it to a text file.  For Sprint 2, we had to take the data
# from Sprint 1, and create a SQLite database and subsequent table to display the data.  For Sprint 3, we had to 
# download an RSS feed and store it in a similar manner as the .JSON file in part 1. 

# I started off pretty well.  I was able to get the data and set up a table with the RSS feed, but struggled 
# with the writing od the tests.  It has become very apparent to me it takes a lot of practice to master these.
# I added some testing but was confused about how to make the parameters accept both good and bad data,
# simultaneously.

# I was able to create a test table, but had some trouble populating it.  Once I figured out it had to be in the
# test folder, it worked with ease.  The database part of this project has been fun to me.  There is a lot of 
# information on the web, both light and dark, so I was able to use the basic functionality of SQLite.  I can't
# wait to see what Sprint 4 has for me.
